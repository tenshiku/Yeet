# Yeet Plugin

---

The "Yeet" plugin introduces an engaging and interactive feature to Minecraft servers, enabling players with the ability to lift and carry other players within the game world. With this plugin installed, players gain the ability to lift and carry another player above their head, as well as throwing the player.

## Mechanics/Features

- Carry Mechanic - player laying down on top?
  
- Throw mechanic - maybe if you’re carrying a player you hold down shift to select the throw strength and once you release it yeets (throws) the player
  
- Put down mechanic - put the player down instead of throwing them, right click?
  
- Maybe a command for players to disable the ability for them to be picked up so it’s not super annoying
